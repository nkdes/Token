# Clicker Smart Contract

This project implements a simple Clicker smart contract using Cairo and Starknet.

## Project Structure

### Files

- `src/contract.cairo`: Contains the implementation of the Clicker smart contract.
- `src/interface.cairo`: Defines the interface for the Clicker smart contract.
- `Scarb.toml`: Configuration file for the Scarb package manager.
- `Scarb.lock`: Lock file generated by Scarb.

### Clicker Contract

The Clicker contract allows users to track and increment click counts. It includes the following functionalities:

- `total_clicks`: Returns the total number of clicks.
- `clicks_of`: Returns the number of clicks for a specific clicker.
- `click`: Increments the click count for the caller and the total click count.

### Interface

The interface for the Clicker contract is defined in [`src/interface.cairo`](src/interface.cairo):

## Deployment

This contract is already declared and deployed on Sepolia

## Multicall

The `multicall.cairo` file is used in the frontend to batch multiple contract calls into a single transaction. It is a complex file for beginners, but for the purposes of this demo, we don't need to delve into its details.
